        <p>LOS ANGELES — Samara "Sammi" Sweet, the charismatic executive chef who captured hearts on Season 22 of Fox's hit reality show <em>Hell's Kitchen</em>, has died at the age of 29 following a fatal car accident, her family confirmed Monday.</p>
        
        <p>Sweet, known for her fiery personality and culinary prowess that earned her a third-place finish on the Gordon Ramsay-hosted competition in 2023, was pronounced dead at the scene after her vehicle collided with a semi-truck on Interstate 405 near Westwood late Sunday night. Authorities are investigating the cause, but preliminary reports suggest adverse weather conditions may have played a role.</p>

        <div class="caption" style="float: right; width: 400px;">Sammi competing on Hell's Kitchen.</div>
        
        <p>"Sammi was a light in our lives, full of passion and determination," her sister, Jenna Sweet, said in a statement shared with PEOPLE. "She inspired so many with her journey on <em>Hell's Kitchen</em> and her unwavering commitment to her craft. We are heartbroken and ask for privacy during this difficult time."</p>
        
        <p>Born in Los Angeles, Sweet began her culinary career at a young age, honing her skills in local kitchens before rising to become an executive chef at a trendy fusion restaurant in Hollywood. Her appearance on <em>Hell's Kitchen</em> Season 22, which aired from September 2023 to January 2024, showcased her talent for innovative dishes and her ability to thrive under pressure. Despite intense challenges from Ramsay, Sweet's quick wit and team spirit made her a fan favorite.</p>
        
        <p>Gordon Ramsay, the show's iconic host, expressed his condolences on social media early Monday. "Devastated to hear about Sammi's passing," Ramsay wrote on X (formerly Twitter). "She was a fierce competitor with incredible potential. My thoughts are with her family and loved ones."</p>

        <p>Fellow contestants from the season also paid tribute. Johnathan Benvenuti, the runner-up, posted a photo of the two on Instagram, captioning it: "Rest in peace, Sammi. You were one of the best. Gone too soon." Winner Ryan O'Sullivan echoed the sentiment, telling Fox News: "Sammi brought energy to every challenge. This is a huge loss for all of us."</p>
        
        <p>Sweet's death comes amid a wave of reflections on the high-stakes world of competitive cooking shows. Fans have flooded social media with messages of grief, sharing clips of her memorable moments, including her signature dessert that wowed the judges during the black jacket phase.</p>
        
        <p>A memorial service is being planned in Los Angeles, with details to be announced by the family. In lieu of flowers, donations are encouraged to the James Beard Foundation, which supports aspiring chefs—a cause Sweet championed.</p>
